Petroleum Consumption in the U.S.
================
by Group Seven

## Summary

Background:
The project examines the patterns in energy consumption, expenditure, and price across US states. We focus our analysis on state interactions with petroleum, as it is one of the most relied upon energy sources for all states across the US. Understanding how petroleum consumption, price, and expenditure vary across different geographic regions and state types provides insight into energy efficiency, elasticity, as well as infrastructure demand throughout the country. 


Research Questions:
The central research question guiding our project was: What are the overall trends that are shown in US energy consumption, expenditure, and price? The project explores how petroleum consumption differs when looking at the total consumption versus per capita data, the impact that price fluctuations have on a state’s dependence on petroleum, and how petroleum spending varies relative to a state’s consumption levels. Together, these questions provide a multi-dimensional understanding of petroleum dynamics across US states with a focus on the interactions between cost, dependency, consumption, and efficiency. 


Methods/Approach Used:
For our project we utilized publically available data from the US Energy Information Administration for 2019. The dataset included statistics regarding state-level energy consumption, prices and expenditure across various energy sources. The consistency of petroleum as a primary energy source across all states made it most suitable for comparative analysis. We developed three main visualizations to examine trends: a heat map of commercial petroleum consumption by state, a scatter plot comparing petroleum price and state dependence, and a scatter plot comparing petroleum expenditure per capita with petroleum dependence. 


Findings/take home:
The first visualization consists of a heat map depicting the total commercial petroleum consumption by states across the US. The visualization indicates that the states that have the highest populations and are the largest industrial regions have the highest total petroleum consumption. This includes states such as California, Texas, and New York. This is shown on the map through darker shading with rural areas with lower industrial capacities having lighter shading indicating a low total consumption value. However, when we produced the same visualization utilizing per-capita petroleum consumption, our results differed. States such as Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, which possess low population concentrations and industrial activity, ranked among the highest per-capita consumers. This suggests that while high-population areas account for the majority of the total consumption, small states can exhibit higher reliance per resident due to factors such as climate, rural infrastructure, and limited access and ability to consume alternative fuel sources. 

Our first scatter plot explores the relationship between petroleum price and petroleum dependence. The results showed little correlation between a state’s petroleum price and their petroleum dependence. This lack of correlation is shown on the visualization by the relatively flat line of best fit. This finding suggests that petroleum in the US is a mostly inelastic good, as demand remains stable despite price fluctuations. This could be due to the incredible dependence and necessity of petroleum for transportation, commercial activities, and heating making it difficult for consumers to reduce consumption when prices increase. 

The second scatter plot we produced displays petroleum dependence by expenditure per capita. Unlike the first plot which showed no significant relationship, this visualization suggests a negative relationship between dependence and spending. The data suggests that states that rely more heavily on petroleum tended to spend less per person on petroleum than states that were less reliant. This result suggests that states with a high petroleum dependence benefit from a more efficient distribution and consumption process which reduces their petroleum cost per consumer. In contrast, states with lower petroleum usage may have less developed systems of consumption and distribution which cause the higher per-capita expenditures.


Conclusions/Limitations/ideas for future research:
Our visualizations indicate that population size and industry drive total consumption but per-capita data reveals smaller states are some of the top consumers at the individual level. Petroleum dependence is inelastic as petroleum price shows minimal correlation to state dependence. Expenditures per capita decline as reliance increases, suggesting efficiency and lower spending in high-use states. Overall, our analysis indicates that petroleum usage is unevenly distributed across states with major variation in expenditure and use at both the total and per capita level.
